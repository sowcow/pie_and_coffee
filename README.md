# What

Tailor-made experimental minimalistic anki-like web app to train reading and short memory retention
of abstract random compositions of lines or shapes produced.

- fast loop
- relaxed process: self check and own choice of what to do with it
- randomization of images order, scaling, and position on the screen
- circular frame with Ï€/6 angles grid on it

# Why

Target audience:
1. Corparate spies who need to remember lots of pie charts from financial reports
1. Coffee-holics who can't fall asleep

# So

- see a pie
- swipe
- reproduce with stylus
- swipe
- compare
- swipe
- ...
- swipe-up for the menu

# But

- use a android tablet in portrait mode and firefox
- android browsers are not smart about stylus now so the app will miss moves that use full force with right angle to the screen
- happy path is the only path
